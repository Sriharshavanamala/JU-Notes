# DataBase
* To Connect your local-system ```MySQL``` to A2019, use ```Database:Connect```
    1. Session Name: Anything you like
    2. Connection Mode: User defined
    3. Database type: MySQL
    4. Server: localhost
    5. Fill up database name,username,password
    6. Check on use specific database and give path to ```mysql-connector-java-8.0.21.jar``` file, generally found in ```C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\Connector J 8.0\``` path
* ```Database:Read from``` this activity is used to fetch data from table into A2019 system memory,basically it does not store the table data into any variable but you can access it using ```Loop``` activity
* ```Database:Read from``` this activity can also be used to store any tabular data from ```database``` to ```csv``` file
* ```Database: Export to data table``` as the name refers this activity is used to fetch data from database using ```SELECT``` query and stores it into a ```datatable``` variable
* ```Insert/Update/Delete``` activity is used to insert/update/delete data or to execute queries like truncate/drop/alter etc
* The queries works same as SQL with same input and output

# Play Sound
* It is a simple activity that is used to play sound
* ```Play beep``` plays a simple ```windows sound```
* ```Play media file``` is used to play a ```.wav``` or ```.mp3``` file

# PGP
* This activity is used for encryption-decryption of data to be send over network
* ```PGP: Create keys``` activity is used to create ```Public``` and ```Private``` keys, remember to give their extension as ```.txt```
* The above generated ```Public``` key is used for file encryption using ```PGP: Encrypt files```, in which a ```Source file path``` is given and an folder is created containing the ```encrypted``` file
* The encryption can be done using different kinds of ```Encryption Algorithms``` such as:
    1. AES256
    2. AES128
    3. AES192
    4. Blowfish
    5. CAST5
    6. Idea
    7. TripleDes
    8. Twofish256
* these are various algorithms which are used based on circumstance
* The files ```Encrypted``` using above activity are ```Decrypted``` using ```PGP: Decrypt files``` which requires the ```PRIVATE KEY``` as input generated in pair with ```Public Key```


# Screen
* ```Screen: Capture area``` activity is used to capture a screen shot of specific area from any window though it works perfectly only if ```Screen Resolution``` is set to ```100%```. (Brings application in forefront)
* ```Screen: Capture desktop``` activity is used to take the screenshot, unlike the ```name``` this activity will take a complete screen clipping and save it in preferred location
* ```Screen: Capture window``` activity is used to take the screenshot of any application/window and save it in preferred location. It is also set to take pic at resolution of ```100%``` thus without this, the snapshot will not be much satisfactory


# OCR
* These activities can scrap any image based text as well as normal text from any web page
* These should be used with ```Screen Resolution``` set to ```100%``` for perfect results
* ```OCR: Capture Window``` activity is used for ```ScreenScraping``` techinique. It is highly efficient to scrap any screen and convert it into a string format
* It supports scrapping different languages like ```English```, ```Japanese```, ```Russian```
* ```OCR: Capture area``` activity is used scraping a particular area and converting to string format. It is really efficient
* ```OCR: Capture image by path``` activity is used to get text from images stored in system/control room
* ```OCR: Capture image by url``` works same as ```image by path```, just that instead of ```downloaded``` image path you have to provide the ```url``` of the image
* In ```OCR: Capture image by url``` activity the image url should refer the type of extension the image has such as ```https://www.automationanywhere.com/images/easyblog_articles/389/b2ap3_large_better-productivity-and-security.jpg```


# System
* The System package contains most simple activities that are used to 
    1. Lock Computer
    2. Logoff
    3. Restart
    4. Shutdown


# MS Word
* ```MS Word: Create MS Word Document``` activity is used to create word document with some text written in it(optional)
* Input Paramers:
    1. FilePath -> Location where the file should be created
    2. FileName -> name of the file, extension will be ```docx``` by default, thus no need to mention
    3. Paragraph(optional) -> Content to initialize the document with
* ```MS Word: Add Paragraph``` activity is used to add some new paragraph content or basically append more text to already existing file
* ```MS Word: Insert Text``` activity


# Word2Pdf
* In A2019 by default there is no such activity for this particular task but it can be achieved easily and efficiently using Python integration
```py
import sys
import os
import comtypes.client

def Word2Pdf(Files):
    wdFormatPDF = 17
    word = comtypes.client.CreateObject('Word.Application')
    doc = word.Documents.Open(Files[0].replace("/","//"))
    doc.SaveAs(Files[1].replace("/","//") ,FileFormat=wdFormatPDF)
    doc.Close()
    word.Quit()
```

# XML

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<SOH>
<environment name="dev">
    <path1>Hello</path1>
    <path2>Hi</path2>
</environment>
<environment name="pro">
    <path1>Hello</path1>
    <path2>Hi</path2>
</environment>
</SOH>
```
* XML Expression to access nodes through parent is like ```/SOH/environment/path2```
* Another way is using relative expression that is like ```//environment/path1```
* To get multiple nodes, one can ```//environment/path1```


# IQ Bot
* When you trigger document classification using IQ Bot, ```Unsupervised learning``` technology comes into play
* It can extract data from scanned/digital/image documents/ emails
* Technologies used in IQ Bot are:
    1. Unsupervised Learning
    2. Fuzzy Logic
    3. Computer Vision
    4. Machine Learning
    5. Convolutional Neural Network
    6. Tesseract Fine Reader
    7. Key-Value / coordinate mapping (Auto-mapping)
    8. Point and Click

* Flow of IQ Bot is like:
    ```Instance creation >> Document analysis >> Bot training >> Production processing >> Document validation >> progress monitoring```
* 5 Components of IQ Bot are:
    1. Dashboards -> progress and health of projects
    2. Learning Instances -> train bots
    3. Domains -> types of Learning instances
    4. Bot -> manage bots
    5. Administration -> export / import instances across servers
* During document analysis phase, An IQ bot does the following tasks:
    1. Applying classifier
    2. Performing semantic analysis
    3. Learning from aliases
    4. Recognizing patterns
    5. Extracting data
    6. Group similar documents
* Extracted data can be saved in ```CSV``` files


## Instance
* Created in staging:demo environment
* Creating an Instance, follows:
    1. Reviewing document samples -> which fields are common and which are unique
    2. Filling in details -> type of document and fields required to fetch
    3. Uploading document samples -> documents to train the IQ Bot
    4. Adding field,table columns, or repeated sections -> If a field is a part of table, choose ```add as table/repeated section``` else ```Add as form```
    5. Triggering instance creation and document analysis
* When selecting and reviewing documents for data extraction, it is important to keep the following points in mind:
    1. Besides image formats, such as TIFF,JPG, and PNG files, you can also upload PDF,Vector,Raster and Hybrid(Vector and Raster) documents for classification and analysis
    2. You must use documents with a resolution value of atleast 300 Dots Per Inch (dpi)
    3. You can add additional documents even after creating the learning instance


## Training Bot
* Click on ```Edit Bot``` or ```Create Bot``` in the ```Actions Panel```
* Left Panel -> Displays the fields and table columns from the document that were defined during instance creation
* Center Panel -> Allows label and value mapping for the fields and table columns
* Right Panel -> Displays the document sample that was uploaded to the learning instance
* System Identification Region (SIR) -> Optical Character Recognition (OCR) extracted value of a field/column (also called a text segment)

* To check which value is being captured, hover over the value
* To clear the mapping -> click on cross mark
* To fetch value without Label, set the label name and value mapped to the value
* To set alias in ```Field Label``` use ```|``` symbol such as ```Label1 | Label 2```
* If there are fields, which exist in one document but not in other, ```Go to Field options and choose optional```
* In field options,we can set the ```correct pattern``` for any field such as ```dd-mm-yyyy```

* ```View each Group document``` let you change the document form which the training can be done
* For table data extraction, First open the ```Table/section settings``` and set the value of ```Best field for table/repeated section``` to the column name which:
    1. Should never contain null values
    2. Should not contain data records that may span multiple lines
* To remove a column from a pre-defined table, create another table and move the column to new one
* For table mapping, one should map the end of table for proper extraction

* To extract data from number of checkboxes, set the data-type as ```checkbox group``` and select all the ```checkbox fields```
* Then capture the ```individual checkboxes``` and set the ```checkbox group``` to above selected field
* Once all the ```errors``` are fixed a ```green tick``` is ```visible```on right-side of the Document name


## Extract Repeated Table Sections
1. Check the ```Table/section settings``` for best matched column
2. Column Value should be matched to the column name itself with proper data type
3. For the repeated section, select the column with all fields containg values
4. To Link sections:
    * Go to the ```Table/Section settings``` of the table whose data you want to link
    * Go to ```Link tables/sections```
    * Select the table and column to link the field with
    * All the tables will be matched
5. To get data in ```csv``` for better verification, click on ```Export to CSV```


## Best Practices
1. Adding Sections
2. Making columns optional when needed
3. Selecting an appropriate best field for repeated sections


## IQ Bots in Production
* To Send IQ Bots to Production
    1. Bots are required to be send into production by ```toggling``` actions tab
    2. Followed by sending the complete ```instance``` to production by ```toggling``` actions tab
* As output to IQ Bots processing, 4 folders are created:
    1. Success Folder -> Successfully extracted comma-separated value (CSV) files
    2. Invalid Folder -> Files marked invalid through the Validator
    3. Not Processed Folder -> Files with layout that have not been trained
    4. Unclassified Folder -> Rejected files that contains missing fields or mismatched language


## Document Validation and Monitoring Progress
* Steps in this process:
    1. Launching the Validator
    2. Correcting field data
    3. Marking documents invalid
    4. Reviewing Output folder
* To Launch validator : Go to learning instance and click on validator
* Correct Values in the documents and save the documents, on each manual correction the IQ Bot will learn the problems and may processed the mistakes itself
* If document can not be corrected manually, mark it as ```Invalid```
* After Validation, the saved documents will also be saved in the ```Success``` folder

## Custom Logic
* In the field settings, we can apply ```Python``` logics to interpret any field value
* To access field value , use ```field_value```
* You can use multiple modules like pandas,numpy,API processing etc.

## Macro Logic to Separate Form Field Data and Table Field Data
```vb
Sub IQBot(Col As String,FileName As String)
    Sheets(1).Name = "Table Data"
    Range("A1:" + Col + "2").Select
    Selection.Copy
    Sheets.Add After:=ActiveSheet
    ActiveSheet.Paste
    Sheets(2).Name = "Form Data"
    Sheets(1).Select
    Selection.EntireColumn.Delete
    ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs FileName,FileFormat:=51
    ActiveWorkbook.Close
End Sub
```
