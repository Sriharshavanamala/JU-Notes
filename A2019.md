    3. Database type: MySQL
    4. Server: localhost
    5. Fill up database name,username,password

* ```Database:Read from``` this activity is used to fetch data from table into A2019 system memory,basically it does not store the table data into any variable but you can access it using ```Loop``` activity
* ```Database:Read from``` this activity can also be used to store any tabular data from ```database``` to ```csv``` file
* ```Database: Export to data table``` as the name refers this activity is used to fetch data from database using ```SELECT``` query and stores it into a ```datatable``` variable
* ```Insert/Update/Delete``` activity is used to insert/update/delete data or to execute queries like truncate/drop/alter etc
* The queries works same as SQL with same input and output

# Play Sound
* It is a simple activity that is used to play sound
* ```Play beep``` plays a simple ```windows sound```
* ```Play media file``` is used to play a ```.wav``` or ```.mp3``` file

# PGP
* This activity is used for encryption-decryption of data to be send over network
* ```PGP: Create keys``` activity is used to create ```Public``` and ```Private``` keys, remember to give their extension as ```.txt```
* The above generated ```Public``` key is used for file encryption using ```PGP: Encrypt files```, in which a ```Source file path``` is given and an folder is created containing the ```encrypted``` file
* The encryption can be done using different kinds of ```Encryption Algorithms``` such as:
    1. AES256
    2. AES128
    3. AES192
    4. Blowfish
    5. CAST5
    6. Idea
    7. TripleDes
    8. Twofish256
* these are various algorithms which are used based on circumstance
* The files ```Encrypted``` using above activity are ```Decrypted``` using ```PGP: Decrypt files``` which requires the ```PRIVATE KEY``` as input generated in pair with ```Public Key```


# Screen
* ```Screen: Capture area``` activity is used to capture a screen shot of specific area from any window though it works perfectly only if ```Screen Resolution``` is set to ```100%```. (Brings application in forefront)
* ```Screen: Capture desktop``` activity is used to take the screenshot, unlike the ```name``` this activity will take a complete screen clipping and save it in preferred location
* ```Screen: Capture window``` activity is used to take the screenshot of any application/window and save it in preferred location. It is also set to take pic at resolution of ```100%``` thus without this, the snapshot will not be much satisfactory

def Word2Pdf(Files):
    wdFormatPDF = 17
    word = comtypes.client.CreateObject('Word.Application')
    doc = word.Documents.Open(Files[0].replace("/","//"))

# XML

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<SOH>
<environment name="dev">
    <path1>Hello</path1>
    <path2>Hi</path2>
</environment>
<environment name="pro">
    <path1>Hello</path1>
    <path2>Hi</path2>
</environment>
</SOH>
```
* XML Expression to access nodes through parent is like ```/SOH/environment/path2```
* Another way is using relative expression that is like ```//environment/path1```
* To get multiple nodes, one can ```//environment/path1```
