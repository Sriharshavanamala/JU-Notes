# Agile
* Agile is winning as more proof points show that it is better than traditional ways of working in adapting to today's business needs
* Agile is a set of values and principles writeen by 17 software development experts
* Agile manifesto has 4 values and 12 principles
* Different frameworks in Agile are:
    1. XP (Extreme Programming)
    2. Crystal
    3. Scrum
    4. DSDM
    5. FDD

# Scrum
* Scrum is the most used framework of Agile because it is simple to understand and quick in revealing the real progress
* The maximum size of a Scrum Team is 11(1+1+9)
* A Shortcut to remember is 3 - 5 - 3
1. First 3
    * There is no manager within Scrum Team. There are only 3 roles. The management activities are distributed among them
    * The 3 roles are: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
    * Product Owner -> PO doesn't hand over a eatly written requirements document. Instead, PO a value maximizer for users, needs to closely work with the team to evolve the customer needs on a continuous basis
    * Scrum Master -> SM is like a sports coach. SC teaches the team about how to work in Scrum.But SM will not command or direct the team about how to perform their technical work. Instead they set team performance goals and help the team to achieve it
    * Development Team -> A Team of programmers, testers, architects, UI specialists and so on. But all of them will only carry a role named ```Developer```
2. Second 5
    * Scrum eliminates unplanned meetings with external people.There is no other meetin other than five events (sort of meetings).
    * Scrum also minimizes the meeting time, by strictly time boxing their duration
3. Last 3
    * Scrum mandates only three artifacts that are essectial to communicate about the status of the work. The team can choosw additional documents if the add value

* By design, Scrum Team brings out the ```bottom-up intelligence``` through the team structure and the Scrum rules
* There is no commanding and controlling manager within Scrum. The Scrum Team, which is the team on the ground that knows the reality, takes full ownership and self-organizes their work
* ```KANBAN Board``` comprises of 3 columns ```TO DO```,```In Progress``` and ```Done```

# Devops
* Devops bridges the department silos by bringing Development and Operations together
* DevOps makes the Scrum teams self-sufficient by improved ways of building, release and maintenance
* The Best thing about Devops is that it saves the time and efficiently provides the resources on time such as testing environment, production support, code checks etc.
* DevOps is implemented by different customers in different ways, such as DevOps engineer works within the Scrum team or Scrum teams can directly release to production using automated capability


# Design Thinking Approach
* Design thinking involves research, prototypical and iterations. It sounds very similar to the iterative and incremental approach of Agile
* Design Thinking is about Product Development where as Agile manifesto is about Software Development
* Design Thinking is finding the right things and Agile is about building the right things
* It is used to validate the assumption that a selected solution is the right solution
* It is quite common that Design Thinking is used to validate that right solution is identified, and then agile way of working is applied to build the right solution

# Lean
* Lean is another abstraction (like Agile Manifesto) about improved ways of working. Lean comes from manufacturing andis older than Agile. Both Agile and Lean focus on customer value and continuous improvement
* It helps the team to continuously identify and remove non-value adding steps from left end to right end. This reduces waste,increases flow and quick value delivery.
* Quick value delivery improves the team's learning.
* There are 7 types of wastes:
    1. Transportation
    2. Inventory
    3. Motion
    4. Wait Time
    5. Over Production -> Providing additional features without a clear understanding of the need
    6. Over Processing
    7. Defects (TIMWOOD)

# Anti Patterns
* For scenarios where business stakeholders work in a political atmosphere and consensus building is very slow.Agile way of working will develop several roadblocks.This scenario may require more formal protocol based approach ( like in traditional models of phases, milestones and accountabilities)
